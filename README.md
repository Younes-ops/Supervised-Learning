# Supervised-Learning

The purpose of this project is to explore some techniques in supervised learning. 
It is important to realize that understanding an algorithm or technique requires understanding how it behaves under a variety of circumstances. 

## 5 Supervised Learning algorithms :
    Decision trees with some form of pruning
    Neural networks
    Boosting
    Support Vector Machines
    k-nearest neighbors

## Two Classification problem 
 The first classification problem is about Churn Prediction for a Telecommunication
company by analyzing all relevant customer data and how they use the service and
predicting which customers are most likely to cancel a subscription.

 The second Classification Problem is Stars Classification
The classification of stars based on their spectral features is known as stellar classifica-
tion in astronomy.
